<h1>block chain</h1>
<p><em>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</em></p>
<p><em>For</em>   other uses, see Block chain (disambiguation).</p>
<p>A<small> blockchain</small> is a distributed ledger with growing lists of records ,<sup>(blocks) </sup>that are securely linked together via cryptographic hashes.<mark>[1][2][3][4]</mark> Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the<del> previous</del>next block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree, where data nodes are represented by leaves).<br> Since each block contains information about the previous block, they effectively form a chain (compare linked list data structure), with each additional block linking to the ones before it. Consequently,<mark> blockchain</mark> transactions are irreversible in that, once they are recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks.</p>

<h2>HISTORY</h2>
<hr>
<p>Cryptographer David Chaum first proposed a blockchain-like protocol in his 1982 dissertation "Computer Systems Established, Maintained, and Trusted by Mutually Suspicious Groups."[10] Further work on a cryptographically secured chain of blocks was described in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta.[4][11] They wanted to implement a system wherein document timestamps could not be tampered with.

    In 1992, Haber, Stornetta, and Dave Bayer incorporated Merkle trees into the design, which improved its efficiency by allowing several document certificates to be collected into one block.[4][12] Under their company Surety, their document certificate hashes have been published in The New York Times every week since 1995.[13]

    The first decentralized blockchain was conceptualized by a person (or group of people) known as Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008. Nakamoto improved the design in an important way using a Hashcash-like method to timestamp blocks without requiring them to be signed by a trusted party and introducing a difficulty parameter to stabilize the rate at which blocks are added to the chain.<br><br>[4] The design was implemented the following year by Nakamoto as a core component of the cryptocurrency bitcoin, where it serves as the public ledger for all transactions on the network.[3]</p>
